mWaterfall_6651e228		I better go and check it out!	game/ChapterBadEnd.rpy	140
mWaterfall_1def37ac	mc	I'm sure he went this way...	game/ChapterBadEnd.rpy	147

mWaterfall_d4483fbe		M-Maybe it wasn't a good idea for me to come here.	game/ChapterBadEnd.rpy	159
mWaterfall_14dc2e1f		I stepped backwards, tripping over something small which made me fall to the ground.	game/ChapterBadEnd.rpy	160

ChapterBadEnd_59ab9be1		We didn't speak much after that night and things just got from bad to worse.	game/ChapterBadEnd.rpy	235
ChapterBadEnd_c94b237c		Every moment felt like the day we first met, except things got a bit distant between us.	game/ChapterBadEnd.rpy	236
ChapterBadEnd_aa8b1e18		He avoided me, almost like he was pretending I wasn't there.	game/ChapterBadEnd.rpy	237
ChapterBadEnd_7bc5c586		Even when I left the island he made no eye contact or said anything.	game/ChapterBadEnd.rpy	238
ChapterBadEnd_017f7613		We just... ended up going our separate ways...	game/ChapterBadEnd.rpy	239
ChapterBadEnd_9e23af1f		As I looked up to the blue sky while I drifted away on the boat. A tear streamed down my face.	game/ChapterBadEnd.rpy	240
